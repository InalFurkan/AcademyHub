PROJECT TITLE Academy Hub: Student Information System

PROJECT DESCRIPTION Academy Hub is a website divided into two main sections: the Student Panel and the Admin Panel. Both enrolled students and admins have login credentials, allowing them to access pages specifically designed for their needs. Admins can manage various elements such as students, lectures, and announcements. They have the ability to create, edit, and delete entries as necessary. Students, on the other hand, can log in to access their educational details, view their enrolled courses, corresponding exam scores, weekly schedule, announcements, and personal profile information.

This project aims to build upon an existing student information system, like the one used by my university, by simplifying its functionality while retaining the core features. By enhancing accessibility and focusing on user-friendly design, it presents my vision of what a modern student information system should look like.
